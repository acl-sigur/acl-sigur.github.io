## Elections

Nominations: All participants were nominated to the SIGUR board. Everyone, eight participants, voted in agreement.

Mika Hämäläinen was selected as a chair. Flammie Pirinen was selected as a vice-chair. The vote was unanimous. 

## Next Workshop

We could apply to be part of ACL or EMNLP. We can't apply any longer for the next year's conferences, but can for the one after. Two years was considered a good cycle for IWCLUL. 

It was discussed whether SIGUR should widen the scope beyond the Uralic languags. We cannot compete with workshops on endangered languages. It was suggested we could include misrepresentations in NLP. Another suggestion was about morphologically rich languages. It was also mentioned that SIG can organize any kinds of workshops, that is not tied to the group itself. 

We will apply for a new workshop next year, so that it will take place in 2025. [CIFU](https://cifu14.ut.ee/homepage) is one alternative. Having even two events in 2025 is not impossible, as CIFU and larger NLP conferences are so different in their audience and scope.  

## Announcements

No announcements were made.

## AOB

Summer school could be one possibility. This could also include NLP and DH topics that are not only Uralic languages related. Applying for funding is also one possibility. Helsinki is one potential location. The details will be discussed later. 

Shared tasks are also one possibility.

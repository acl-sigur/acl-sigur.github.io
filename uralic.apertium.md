# Uralic apertium

Uralic apertium is a collective web site to provide free web-based machine
translation for Uralic languages using existing Apertium langyage resources.
For more information about apertium, see [apertium 
wiki](http://wiki.apertium.org). For more information about Uralic languages,
see [Uralic languages on 
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages). This translation
is partially maintained by [ACL SIGUR](http://acl-sigur.github.io), the ACL
special interest group for Uralic languages (but really just by me,
[flammie](http://flammie.github.io). The 
[current translation machine](http://39476.s.time4vps.cloud/) is hosted
on time4vps small node, so the usage is capped to 500 megabytes of network
traffic per month and some very little CPU time per month. If you use more
it will be blocked.

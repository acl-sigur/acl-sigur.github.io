# The ACL Special Interest Group on Uralic Languages

The **Association for Computational Linguistics Special Interest Group on Uralic Languages (ACL SIGUR)** is dedicated to advancing the study, development, and application of computational methods for Uralic languages. This includes both majority and minority languages such as Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, SÃ¡mi languages, Komi, Mari, and many others within the Uralic language family.

## IWCLUL

**[IWCLUL 2025](iwclul2025.html)**

The **International Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Uralic Languages (IWCLUL)** is an annual gathering that brings together researchers working on NLP, linguistics and language technology for Uralic languages. Since its inception in 2015, IWCLUL has served as a key venue for presenting advances in low-resource Uralic language processing, promoting resource creation and fostering collaboration across academia and language communities.


## Our Mission

ACL SIGUR fosters collaboration among researchers, developers and language communities to promote:

- **Cutting-edge research** in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Uralic languages  
- **Development of linguistic resources**, including corpora, lexicons and tools  
- **Support for endangered languages** within the Uralic family through digital technologies  
- **Exchange of knowledge** through events such as IWCLUL

## Why Uralic Languages?

[Uralic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages) present unique linguistic features and challenges for computational processing, including rich morphology, complex case systems and often limited data availability. These factors make them an exciting area for innovation in low-resource NLP and linguistically informed modeling.

# The 9th International Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Uralic Languages IWCLUL 2024


The 9th International Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Uralic Languages (IWCLUL 2024) will be organized as a self-standing event. The proceedings of the event will be published in [the ACL anthology](https://aclanthology.org). The conference will take place in November 28-29, 2024 in Helsinki, Finland at [Metropolia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.metropolia.fi/fi).

The purpose of IWCLUL is to bring together researchers working on computational approaches to [Uralic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages) (e.g. Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian, Permyak), Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest), Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi, Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian, Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic, Livonian and Ludic). All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are endangered. Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):

- Multilingual approaches in NLP presenting work on at least one Uralic language
- LLMs and their use in the context of (endangered) Uralic languages
- Position papers
- Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages
- Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries
- Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as spelling or grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing
- Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks
- Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to Uralic languages
- Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational linguistics for one or more Uralic languages
- Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work
- How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns, games with a purpose

## Paper submission

We solicit original and unpublished work related to NLP approaches for Uralic languages. Short papers can be up to 4 pages in length and long papers up to 8 pages. Both submission formats can have an unlimited number of pages for references. All submissions must follow the [ACL stylesheet](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) ([Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj)).

The submissions must be anonymous and they will be peer-reviewed by our program committee. The peer review is double blind. 

Papers must be submitted using OpenReview by the submission deadline. At least one of the authors of an accepted paper must attend the event to present the paper. **There will be no registration/publication fees**.

Accepted papers (short and long) will be published in the proceedings that will appear in the ACL Anthology. Accepted papers will also be given an additional page to address the reviewers’ comments. The length of a camera ready submission can then be 5 pages for a short paper and 9 for a long paper with an unlimited number of pages for references.

You may also contribute to the event by submitting a lightning talk. Lightning talks are submitted as 750-word abstracts. Lightning talks are suited for discussing ideas or presenting work in progress. The abstracts will be published in a lightning proceedings.
